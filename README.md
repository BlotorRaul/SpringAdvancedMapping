# Hibernate Advanced Mapping with Spring

## Overview:
This application utilizes the advanced mapping features of Hibernate in conjunction with the dependency injection and transaction management capabilities of Spring. It offers a robust framework for constructing sophisticated data models with both one-dimensional and bi-dimensional relationships, and for interacting with databases in Java applications.

## Key Features:
- **Hibernate Advanced Mapping:** The application employs Hibernate's advanced mapping capabilities, encompassing one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many associations. This enables modeling of intricate relationships between entities.
- **Data Access Layer:** The application implements a flexible data access layer using Spring Data or Hibernate's native APIs, offering a consistent approach to database interactions.
- **RESTful Web Services (Optional):** If needed, the application can expose RESTful endpoints through Spring MVC or Spring Boot, enabling smooth integration with client applications.
